# Menstrual Cycle and Height

Citizen science study of relationship between menstrual cycle and daily height.

## Motivation

I am curious about the **daily** variation in human heights over the course of a 16 week period. 
I have reason to believe that females (XX) who are not on hormonal birth control 
experience daily variations in height that may be explained by hormonal fluctuations 
over the course of their menstrual cycle. However, I would like to collect a 
record of daily heights from a wide variety of individuals to confirm this.

## Data
 
Ideally I would collect heights from these classes of individuals:
 
1. Females of child bearing age, not pregnant, not on hormonal birth control
1. Females of child bearing age, not pregnant, on daily birth control
1. Females who are pregnant
1. Females who are post-menopausal
1. Females under 10
1. Males over 20
1. Males under 10
 
For every individual ideally we would also need ethnic background, age, and 
location by state/province/country. Also, for the females, I would need 
information on whether they have a menstrual cycle, and which days of the 
month they were menstruating (to line up with the heights measurements).
 
**Group 1** is the group of interest, ALL of the others are potential controls.
 
### Data Collection 
 
I do not have a lab that is able to do this, but with some engineering and 
programming I can think of a couple of ways to have individuals collect the 
necessary data themselves.
 
Have someone else measure their height daily, record the values, and send them 
to a central location (or submit a link to a Google Sheet).
Write a web app where people can submit a self photo of their head, where that 
photo includes a black solid horizontal line at recorded height, and a black 
solid vertical line of recorded length, and based on the information from lines 
app can determine individualâ€™s height in the picture. The amount of persons with 
photo capable tablets and phones also means that the number of participants could 
be greatly increased using this method.
 
Solution 1 is easy for me, but restricts participation to those who have someone else who can measure them daily.
 
Solution 2 sounds great for increasing participation, but I don't think I have
the necessary technical know how do it by myself. In addition to calculating 
heights, the app should store the photos so they can be double checked, but should
strip any possible location meta-data, while keeping date meta-data to enable easy ordering by date.
 
Participants should also on the website be able to say whether they agree to making their photos available for reuse.
 
Regardless of outcome, results would be published.
